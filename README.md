# Swift Docker
Official Swift Dockerfile for the Zewo framework.

The Dockerfile is taken from [SwiftDocker/Docker-Swift](https://github.com/swiftdocker/docker-swift). The only modification is that this image will be tagged along with [Zewo/Docker](https://github.com/Zewo/Docker) so that the Zewo docker images can be properly versioned.
